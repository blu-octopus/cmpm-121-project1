My scene is a pink capsule chilling in a mushroom forest. I included low poly forest 3D models and a simple cartoon ski box. I was inspired by the pretty sunsets here at Santa Cruz. The main character is a pink capsule that wandered into the forest.

My main assets are from the "low-poly simple nature pack" created by JustCreate (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/low-poly-simple-nature-pack-162153). The sky box is from the "Sky Box add-on" by Eclypso(https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-add-on-136594). The clouds are from "Awesome low poly fantasy cloud" by Random Games (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/awesome-low-poly-fantasy-clouds-97654).
I used around 70 game objects found from the nature pack to create my scene, with most of them being:
-grass (2pt)
-mushroom 1 (2pt)
-mushroom 2 (2pt)
-rock 1 (2pt)
-rock 2 (2pt)
-rock 3 (2pt)
-rock 4 (2pt)
-rock 5 (2pt)
-ground 1 (2pt)
-ground 2 (2pt)
-ground 3 (2pt)
-flower 1 (2pt)
-flower 2 (2pt)
-bush (2pt)
-sky box texture (2pt)
-cloud 1 (2pt)
-cloud 2 (2pt)
and also used the primitive game object to create basic shapes for:
-water sphere(1 pt)
-main character pink capsule (1 pt)
-plane (1pt)
